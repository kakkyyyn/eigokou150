## Why would I want that?

Writing explicit conditions
in your functions
to check arguments
and throw errors
is a task that
swiftly becomes tiresome
and adds complexity
to your codebase.

The purpose of check-types.js
is to remove this burden
from JavaScript application developers
in an efficient and robust manner,
abstracted by a simple API.

## How little is it?

25 kb unminified with comments, 7.4 kb minified, 2.5 kb minified + gzipped.

## How do I install it?

Via npm:

```
npm i check-types --save
```

Or if you just want the git repo:

```
git clone git@gitlab.com:philbooth/check-types.js.git
```

## How do I use it?

### Loading the library

If you are running in Node.js
or a CommonJS environment,
you can `require` check-types like so:

```javascript
const check = require('check-types');
```

It also the supports
the AMD-style format
preferred by Require.js.

If you are
including check-types.js
with an HTML `<script>` tag,
or neither of the above environments
are detected,
it will export the interface globally as `check`.

### Calling the exported functions

Once you've loaded the library
in your application,
a whole bunch of functions are available
to call.

Most of the functions
are predicates,
which can be executed
in a number of different contexts:

* `check.xxx(thing)`:
  These functions are basic predicates,
  returning true or false
  depending on the type and value of `thing`.

* `check.not.xxx(thing)`:
  The `not` modifier
  negates predicates,
  returning `true` if the predicate returns `false`
  and `false` if the predicate returns `true`.
  It is also itself a function,
  which simply returns
  the negation of
  its argument.

* `check.maybe.xxx(thing)`:
  The `maybe` modifier
  tweaks predicates to
  return `true` if `thing` is `null` or `undefined`,
  otherwise their normal result
  is returned.
  It is also itself a function,
  which returns `true`
  when its argument is `null` or `undefined`,
  otherwise it returns its argument.

* `check.assert.xxx(thing, message)`:
  The `assert` modifier
  changes predicates
  to throw when their result is `false`,
  otherwise it returns `thing`.
  It can be applied
  to the `not` and `maybe` modifiers
  using the forms
  `check.assert.not.xxx(thing, message)` and
  `check.assert.maybe.xxx(thing, message)`.
  It is also itself a function,
  which simply throws
  when its argument is false.

* `check.array.of.xxx(thing)`:
  The `array.of` modifier
  first checks that
  it is operating on an array
  and then applies
  the modified predicate
  to each item
  of the array.
  If the predicate fails
  for any item,
  it returns `false`,
  otherwise it returns `true`.
  It can also be prefixed
  by other modifiers,
  so `check.maybe.array.of`,
  `check.not.array.of`,
  `check.assert.array.of`,
  `check.assert.maybe.array.of` and
  `check.assert.not.array.of`
  all work
  as you would expect
  them to.

* `check.arrayLike.of.xxx(thing)`:
  The `arrayLike.of` modifier
  is synonymous with `array.of`,
  except it operates on array-like objects.

* `check.iterable.of.xxx(thing)`:
  The `iterable.of` modifier
  is synonymous with `array.of`,
  except it operates on iterables.

* `check.object.of.xxx(thing)`:
  The `object.of` modifier
  is synonymous with `array.of`,
  except it operates on an object's properties.

Additionally, there are some batch operations
to help you apply predicates
to each value
of an array or object.
These are implemented by
`check.map`,
`check.any` and
`check.all`.

#### General predicates

* `check.equal(thing, thang)`:
  Returns `true`
  if `thing === thang`,
  `false` otherwise.

* `check.null(thing)`:
  Returns `true`
  if `thing` is `null`,
  `false` otherwise.

* `check.undefined(thing)`:
  Returns `true`
  if `thing` is `undefined`,
  `false` otherwise.

* `check.assigned(thing)`:
  Returns `true`
  if `thing` is not
  `null` or `undefined`,
  `false` otherwise.

* `check.primitive(thing)`:
  Returns `true`
  if `thing` is a primitive type,
  `false` otherwise.
  Primitive types are
  `null`, `undefined`, booleans, numbers, strings and symbols.

* `check.hasLength(thing, value)`:
  Returns `true`
  if `thing` has a length property
  that equals `value`,
  `false` otherwise.

#### String predicates

* `check.string(thing)`:
  Returns `true`
  if `thing` is a string,
  `false` otherwise.

* `check.emptyString(thing, options)`:
  Returns `true`
  if `thing` is the empty string,
  `false` otherwise.

* `check.nonEmptyString(thing, options)`:
  Returns `true`
  if `thing` is a non-empty string,
  `false` otherwise.

* `check.contains(string, substring)`:
  Returns `true`
  if `string` contains `substring`,
  `false` otherwise.

* `check.in(substring, string)`:
  Returns `true`
  if `substring` is in `string`,
  `false` otherwise.

* `check.match(string, regex)`:
  Returns `true`
  if `string` matches `regex`,
  `false` otherwise.

#### Number predicates

* `check.number(thing)`:
  Returns `true`
  if `thing` is a number,
  `false` otherwise.
  Note that
  `NaN`,
  `Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY` and
  `Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY`
  are not considered numbers here.

* `check.integer(thing)`:
  Returns `true`
  if `thing` is an integer,
  `false` otherwise.

* `check.float(thing)`:
  Returns `true`
  if `thing` is a non-integer number,
  `false` otherwise.

* `check.zero(thing)`:
  Returns `true`
  if `thing` is zero,
  `false` otherwise.

* `check.one(thing)`:
  Returns `true`
  if `thing` is one,
  `false` otherwise.

* `check.infinity(thing)`:
  Returns `true`
  if `thing` is positive or negative infinity,
  `false` otherwise.

* `check.greater(thing, value)`:
  Returns `true` if `thing` is a number
  greater than `value`,
  `false` otherwise.

* `check.greaterOrEqual(thing, value)`:
  Returns `true` if `thing` is a number
  greater than or equal to `value`,
  `false` otherwise.

* `check.less(thing, value)`:
  Returns `true` if `thing` is a number
  less than `value`,
  `false` otherwise.

* `check.lessOrEqual(thing, value)`:
  Returns `true` if `thing` is a number
  less than or equal to `value`,
  `false` otherwise.

* `check.between(thing, a, b)`:
  Returns `true` if `thing` is a number
  between `a` and `b`
  (excluding `a` and `b`),
  `false` otherwise.
  The arguments `a` and `b`
  may be in any order,
  it doesn't matter
  which is greater.

* `check.inRange(thing, a, b)`:
  Returns `true` if `thing` is a number
  in the range `a` .. `b`
  (including `a` and `b`),
  `false` otherwise.
  The arguments `a` and `b`
  may be in any order,
  it doesn't matter
  which is greater.

* `check.positive(thing)`:
  Returns `true` if `thing` is a number
  greater than zero,
  `false` otherwise.

* `check.negative(thing)`:
  Returns `true`
  if `thing` is a number
  less than zero,
  `false` otherwise.

  Returns `true`
  if `thing` is an even number,
  `false` otherwise.

#### Boolean predicates

* `check.boolean(thing)`:
  Returns `true`
  if `thing` is a boolean,
  `false` otherwise.

#### Object predicates

* `check.object(thing)`:
  Returns `true`
  if `thing` is a plain-old JavaScript object,
  `false` otherwise.

* `check.emptyObject(thing)`:
  Returns `true`
  if `thing` is an empty object,
  `false` otherwise.

* `check.nonEmptyObject(thing)`:
